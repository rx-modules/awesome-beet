# How to contribute
Anyone can contribute. To contribute, just edit [README.md](README.md) in your fork and make a pull request.

The easiest way to to this is to press the pencil button on the top right of [README.md](README.md) - add your resource, then follow through to make a pull request.

**Formatting guides**
- Add your resource in the format
```
[Resource Name](https://link.to/resource) - description of resource, no beginning capital letter/full stop
```
- Find the relevant section for your resource - if there are similar resources this may help, otherwise you can make your own section
- Put your resource (or new category) in **alphabetical order**

**Adding new content**
* Create a new folder in the [`resources`](resources).
* Add your amazing tip or trick with the cooresponding example files and beet configuration.
* Add a README.md to guide the user alongside a set of instructions on how to build your example.
* Edit the [`resources/README.md`](`resources/README.md`) file and add your tip/trick alongside a small and concise description.
* ???
* Profit.
